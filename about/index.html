<p>I used to be a Web Backend Developer and have built alot of CMS Systems in
Python/DJango and the django-cms.  Before that i have done way to much PHP
and Wordpress/Typo3 then i like to admit. So PHP/Python are the languages
i am most familiar with. I&rsquo;ve done enough JavaScript to  know i&rsquo;m not missing
it and to little golang to say i&rsquo;m good at it.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-architect">Cloud Architect</h2>
<p>For the last 5 years i&rsquo;ve moved to infrastructure development in AWS. First steps
with Cloudformation, various other tools like pythons troposphere, rubys
sparkleformation and other weird forms of cloudformation template generation, before
seeing the light when encountering terraform. But, there is a new kid on the block
and since i&rsquo;m mostly working with aws the aws cdk is the logical next step.</p>
<p>Today terraform and the aws cdk are the tools i like to use when architecting things in
aws. I&rsquo;ve built Openshift/Kubernetes Clusters, Deployment Pipelines with AWS Code* Services,
AMI Bakeries for custom EC2 images, Lambdas behind API Gateways, S3 Buckets to store
built artefacts from CI/CD Tools like gitlab and concourse.io, connected multiple
aws accounts with one another to built out landing zones, spun up vpn connections
to provide into vpcs to have legacy services be reachable from the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="software-developer">Software Developer</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked as a Software Developer for a long time. Started with C++
and Win32/MFC Api before moving over to the web. Back then, php was
new and did not even had classes (php2/3). Had first contact with Java
while developing for Blackberry phones before the iPhone came out and changed
everything. I never did any ios development though, but once android was a thing
i dabble with that as too. But, to be honest, i never liked Java. So i never
really went into Android development.</p>
<p>I always liked Python and still do today. Thats where my strength is and i find
joy working with. I was super stoked when the aws cdk announced its support for python
so i could start working with that. Terraform is nice, yes. But being able to express
your cloud infrastructure in the language you work in is awesome.</p>
<p>There are other languages i&rsquo;ve played around with, but i cant say i&rsquo;m any good at them.
So i wont bother naming them here.</p>
<h2 id="network-engineer">Network Engineer</h2>
<p>Networks at first haunted me. We never got the LAN working before saturday noon, when
we met at a friends house to play counterstrike. Maybe it was because of shitty hardware
or the lack of competence. But these friday nights taught me alot about ip addresses and
networks.</p>
<p>Recently i started to turn back the time and got involved in network engineering. The
networking aspects of kubernetes recalled alot of the concepts. Lately though i&rsquo;ve started
to work with Cisco Products like Meraki, ACI and other very interesting DevNet services
to automate everything in (most of) the layers. While i still have alot to learn i enjoy
getting into this new (old) parts of the cloud and reviving some of my old LAN Party memories
about network trouble shooting.</p>
